# OFDM-System-with-Different-Modulation-
This project delved into OFDM signal transmission and reception using MATLAB. It examined the influence of SNR on BER, considered multipath fading effects, and compared BPSK and QPSK modulation. 



OFDM transmission propagates through a noisy channel with multipath fading. Let's consider, the time domain OFDM signal be x(n), channel impulse response be g(n),
and the additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) be w(n). 
Received OFDM signal,  y(n)=x(n)*g(n)+w(n)
